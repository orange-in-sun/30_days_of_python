# 1) Below we've provided a list of tuples, where each tuple contains details about an employee of a shop: 
# their name, the number of hours worked last week, and their hourly rate. Print how much each employee is 
# due to be paid at the end of the week in a nice, readable format.

employees = [
    ("Rolf Smith", 35, 8.75),
    ("Anne Pun", 30, 12.50),
    ("Charlie Lee", 50, 15.50),
    ("Bob Smith", 20, 7.00)

for wage in employees:
    print(f"{wage[0]}'s weekly wage is {wage[1]*wage[2]}")

# 2) For the employees above, print out those who are earning an hourly wage above average.
total = 0
count = 0
for employee in employees:
    total = total + employee[2]
    count = count + 1

average_wage = total/count

for employee in employees:
    if employee[2]>average_wage:
      print(f"{employee[0]}")
      
# Hint: you can use a for loop and two variables to keep track of the total wage and the number of employees. 
# Then, use the two variables to calculate the average. Finally, add another loop that goes through 
# the employees list again and prints out only those who have an hourly wage above the calculated average.
